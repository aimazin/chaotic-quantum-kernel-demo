# Chaotic Quantum Kernel Demo

## Project Overview
This project showcases a quantum kernel specifically designed for chaotic systems. It provides tools for understanding quantum dynamics and exploring the intersection of chaos theory and quantum computing.

## Features
- Implementation of a chaotic quantum kernel
- Visualization of quantum states and their evolution over time
- Tools for benchmarking the kernel's performance
- Example applications for demonstrating the use of the kernel
