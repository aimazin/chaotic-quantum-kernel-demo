**Author:** Aimé T Shangula
**Date:** February 2026

### Executive Summary
The RYDD-CIST framework introduces a novel approach to Quantum AI as a Service (QaaS) by leveraging **Chaotic Feature Embeddings** and **Ricci Flow-inspired smoothing**. Unlike traditional quantum gate-based systems that require cryogenic cooling, this architecture utilizes topological stability within **SU(n) symmetry groups** to perform high-complexity optimization on classical high-performance hardware (GPUs). 

### Key Innovations
1. **Geometric Data Mapping:** Transforming raw N-dimensional data into tetrahedral manifolds to ensure structural integrity during computation.
2. **Chaotic Quantum Kernels:** Utilizing analytic kernels to simulate quantum-level state exploration without the overhead of physical decoherence.
3. **Systemic Healing:** Implementing discrete Ricci Flow to evolve data manifolds toward equilibrium, effectively "healing" liquidity gaps or network instabilities in real-time.

### Impact & Applications
Benchmarked results demonstrate a [X]% accuracy improvement over classical RBF kernels in high-noise environments. This technology provides a scalable pathway for **Room-Temperature Quantum Utility** in financial risk management, bio-modeling, and resilient infrastructure.
